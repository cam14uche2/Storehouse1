              <p>A storehouse as the name implies is a place where things are kept. In this case, the storehouse in question is referring to that one spiritual person whom the spirit of God has made available in our generation to direct and guide our ways according to the will and principle of God. Just as it was put in Malachi,'Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it'.
Being of the spirit, he is the only one who can do that.
Nevertheless, this operation is carried out from somewhere referred to as the storehouse as well. So now, the storehouse as it refers to a place is more like an information hub where people come to find what to do and, how to do it according to God's principles to have LIFE return to us.!</p>

              <h2 class="mb-4 display-4">ABOUT THE NAME</h2>

              <p><strong>“GOD IS AMONG US”: it is not just a name as we know a name to be. It doubles as an event that has practically taken place with us right now which is why we chose it as the name for the site through which we hope to reach out to as many as seek for the salvation of our human race as well as our melting universe. Furthermore, it is as practical as it is stated. It is not an assumption, not an imagination and, of course, certainly not a wishful thinking stunt. Take it literally, it is true that God is right here, right now with us but not all knows it yet. As a matter of fact, he has been born with us and has been in our midst for more than five decades. But just a few of men have been located by him since the manifestation of his personality among us. He is not who you can find. He will find you before you will get to know that he is, after a number of introductory statements he will make which will prove to you that he is some worth different from the rest of us. It is as practical as you know what it means and how a person is present (in physical body) with a people. That was how the promise in the bible was made in both Isaiah and Matthew; “God with us – Matt. 1: 23”. How it was meant to be revealed and fulfilled is what no man ever knew. Come to think of it, how does God be with a people (as nobody), without anybody present as a person to be the God we should know, see and, hear from? Can men have the office of the president without somebody to serve in that capacity? Why would we ignore that principle when the Spirit of God has it as the core of his operation of God? We will never get it right as long as we keep operating in that vacuum. Men won’t allow for a vacuum in their offices of leadership even for a minute. Why have men done otherwise with the office of God; the ultimate leadership office? Now we know this; that there is someone as God because he has chosen to come and show us how. Without which we cannot figure it out ourselves. If the presence of the president of a nation (country) must not be without a person to communicate information through to the people for a guided course; How can the presence of God with the same people be an empty void? That is ridiculous to even imagine how to think about. Yet, that is the delusion that the entire human race has lived under for centuries. The downward decline that is seen going on in all areas of human endeavor is because of the absence of God with the people as a person. What can you get out of a vacuum? And what could be worse than the fact that they have made for themselves an imaginary image of a “God” in their hearts that dwells in the sky (the same vacuum). This has created an illusion in their minds that it is that sky God that seemingly makes things work for them the way they do. Ignoring
              the fact that nothing is actually working for them in the real sense. Men do get results from their believes, but results do not represent reward. If the foundation of your work is wrong, your result might be noteworthy (humanly speaking), but your rewarder is waiting at the end of the journey (reality seeing). The foundation of men with God have been on the wrong footing and so is the outcome of all their results. God is designed to be the rewarder of every man’s work and if he declares that your foundation is wrong, so is your result and the reward for it will not be any different. The results of a wrong foundation (a wrong course of work) no matter how highly esteemed by men, cannot make the reward of it to be good. That statement needs no further explanation. If your foundation is wrong, every work that is done upon it cannot be right. It can only be assumed to be, and though there may be results, there is also what the reward will be. Nevertheless, while man may determine his result for what he wants, God is the one and only rewarder. No man can determine, nor influence that. You should know that and, work to be sure your foundation is sure before counting on the results you get. For now, based on the foundations of the world according to Psalms 82: 5, that all the foundations of the earth are out of course, it is no doubt that every result from the work that is done upon such a foundation is all fake. You should know that too. How then, do you get to know that your foundation is wrong when your results do come up to your taste; isn’t that deceitful? Only he who knows can figure it out and show us. You cannot do the wrong thing for the right reasons; neither can a man do the right thing for the wrong reasons. This philosophy is based on human judgment. It is either right from the foundation which makes it right all through to the end; or, it is wrong from its foundation and the wrong goes through to the end. It’s a straight judgment. No ‘may be’, no ‘but’.
               </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Moreover, everything you will read and shall read henceforth from this website is not human knowledge. It is not our thinking, could never have come from the human mind (us). It is not and could never have come from listening to any learned men (we don’t claim to be learned) or, academic professors, philosophers, scientists as the case of humanity are in the world today. Neither is this level of knowledge from any of our generations self-acclaimed spiritual leaders. It is from the one and only divine child. The first born among many brethren as he is designated in Romans 8: 29, that having foreknown him, he predestines him to conform to his image (which no man knows as well) and be the first born amongst the rest of us. It is from him that knowledge that is God’s can come from to us. Let’s not be too swollen headed about that. He is made God by whom work would be done in men for good. It is just the divine program. He is 
              the one to whom it is given to show all (humanity), how and where we got it all wrong and also correct us. This is not the kind of knowledge that anyone gets from the four walls of an institution which of course is a human establishment as well. It doesn’t also develop by listening to men who are, and can only be human. This is the knowledge of the divine, coming to us because one of us is born to have it and deliver it to us in accordance to a divine plan which did not originate from men but rather, from the origin of Men. Therefore, sit tight, fasten your search speed and get ready to read and hear what you may never have considered a possibility in human generation, when it really is. No man has the capacity to release such level of indebt information about creation and humanity and the origin and purpose of man except the one to whom it is given. He is the one we have long and quietly followed, and having seen proves in our own lives, out of our encounters with him. We now know, that nothing can be mistaken anymore. This website is our own medium of reaching out to our world (to whomsoever it may concern) to know that we have seen the MESSIAH who found us by chance. That we might stop wasting precious time, effort and resources on the wrong search, for the wrong believes continually, making the wrong appointments, giving the wrong approach to situations, choosing and following the wrong elects, having the wrong labour. But rather, focus on this ultimate and final divine provision that has now been made available to us, all of a sudden. This is programmed to end humanity’s pain that came, not out of willingness to inflict pain on ourselves, but out of an original foundation that was purposefully imposed, to make sure that God’s divine position is not compromised to men’s corrupt ambition. This human condition is clearly stated in Romans 8: 20-22 (read it for yourself).
              </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Listen, the bible is a metaphoric right up. Nothing in it point to history. Everything written there is what was designed to be made manifest throughout the existence of humanity once it starts. Therefore, the notion that Christ came and did whatever and left is simply a myth. Even the Muslim Quran implies the same. They are metaphors spoken in different forms, but implying the same purpose of fulfilment. Those are the major writings which deny all human (identifiable) authorship, but points to a divine program of arrangement by Spiritual inspiration through men unknown (even till date). But human ambition to know like God have driven them to misinterpret them, as a result of a misconception; it is a divine strategy as well. Let it not be a surprise to hear from us that the bible does not begin from Genesis. Nevertheless, a surprise may be inevitable, if you follow and see the origin of God as the beginner as would be carefully outlined. The 
              beginning of God is from John 1: 1. You cannot have God from genesis starting work as the beginner of the beginning where there is no birth of God shown of him at the beginning (yes, call it the birth of God) shown anywhere. The significance of God beginning a creative work in the world with a people that already exists is a clear indication of his presence with the people as a person looking like them which should show how he began. How is God born and formed?  John 1:1 state that in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God and the word was God. This is not about Christianity or any religion. Ask yourself this question; if in the beginning was the word, was it a Christian word, a Muslim word, a word for the Hindus or what? Is it even a written (letters) word in the first place? To factor a particular tribe into this program of creation is complete lack of knowledge which of course is the case with all men today. “The word” is simply the Spirit that started creation of everything with a plan and, it was not written letters; as it is written in 2corinthians3: 6; “who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life (don’t be deceived to think that we are already made ministers by the way that statement is written, it is a metaphoric writing. Always remember that he is; even God, who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were- Romans 4: 17 (and practically makes it appear so: it is a deceit). No man is there yet, for there’ve been no God to make it happen in men. Nonetheless, the work of the word as a Spirit with God will unavoidably be applicable to every creature that was made by him. It is only written in a book that is titled “the bible”. That does not make it a Christian book. The Christian religion only laid claim to it (it is one of those unfortunate cases of the human controversies). Moreover, the word is not the letter, it is the Spirit and it dwells only with God. The Spirit that makes for the word over humanity applies to every man under his creation, irrespective of his religious affiliation or tribe. In fact, where the word is at work with God in men, tribal affiliation (be it religion or otherwise) can pose no limitations. Let’s continue, there was a beginning that had the word (alone without God); then a beginning with God, when he is born but not yet joined with the word which is already waiting for him in the universe. This duo had moments waiting on one another, to merge and form God as one person in the world. Here, the word is the divine Spirit while God is the birth of a human child (as the body), holy and without sin (unlike men who are born in sin) yet he (God), is born in the midst of men, only waiting to be merged with the already existing word (which will be his Spirit) to generate God (Almighty) on the final run. By this process, God is born as 
              a person amongst the people. He is different, not in looks (because he still looks like a man), but in character and performance, he is not a man. This is now that God who begins the genesis of regenerating a dead world of men from Genesis as you read. It is not an event of history, it is designed for the now, even as you read, henceforth and forever (in eternity). Unfortunately, while men were yet in the world with “the word”, when God was not yet born to whom “the word” was to be given, men in their sinful state, took up the word in the absence of God and began declaring things upon themselves as they could perceive, out of the books of letters (the bible), to make it be as though it is God. Howbeit, if it was never God when they started, it cannot become like God! There, by the sin nature, deviated from the original path. If the Spirit did not protect the place of God in this act of men, would men not have usurped God’s place? And, if that was left to stand, would men have a second chance of correction where they could push God out of his rightful place of service? I’m sure you know the answers to all those mind searching questions. The right choice is now here and could be yours too.
              </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Consider also, this statement that “God is not a man”. Does it mean that God is not a human being? No sir! Unknown to men, it is a warning. A stern warning to every man to acknowledge the fact that when God shall be present in the form of a human looking like a man, men should not extend their human treatment to him if you must be safe with him. He has thrown you a warning that he is coming looking like a man (a human person), don’t treat him like a man. Take good note of that now because he is already with us. The question is; how would you know it’s him when you meet him, not being told? Well, that is where his coming like a thief in the night plays out. We know that “night” (as in night time) is not the same in all parts of the world. In other words, night in America is not the same time as night in Africa, in Asia, in Europe and so on. Therefore, that statement is not literally time based and, is not humanly applicable. I had to mention that part for the record. The big mistake is that what men refer to as God is not what God is, and as a result of that, who God actually is, has been lost in that huge misconception. Nevertheless, there is not a doubt that men did not bring themselves into the world. Something or, someone that existed outside men did. He is The Spirit of the Lord and he brought out first, the Spirit of man; he is Man. He performs every function in men. That same Spirit that brought man and by extension procreated into numerous multitudes also programmed that he will produce God from among men (who will not be a Man) and by whose hand he (the Spirit of The Lord) will fix the wrong foundation of humanity which was set so, on purpose, by him (Romans8: 20-22). It is the intuition in human instinct that 
              the Spirit has in men that made them to instinctively call that Spirit of the Lord that produced men as God when actually, God had not been born among men. God has been described by men (by whatever medium they got it) as all powerful, all knowing, omnipresent; and that whatever God has made, no man (absolutely nothing) can spoil it. This is true about who God should be. But so far, when you look very closely to the present creation, and the universe, men still make the same mistake of a misappropriating the identity of God continuously, thereby contradicting his image in their misconception. If God is all powerful (which he is), why have the crisis of humanity and the universe appeared unstoppable? The question is; has God as we have heard of him to be, shown up yet in the midst of these crisis? Has he been born? Is the Spirit running with men now God? No! But if men have been made to perceive and describe God as that then, chances are that such a deity exists. He is yet to show up. When he does, we will all see the difference. The time is now. He is among us to prove us all, wrong. Therefore, it may not be out of place for anybody to have said that there is no historic Jesus (of course there is none) or, even say there is no God when the evidence so far seen cannot support the definition and description of such an all-powerful Spiritual personality. It will only be wrong (if not outrightly bad) to conclude that there never will be. It is not over yet. If men have been made to have the consciousness of such a personality as God, with such ultimate powers attributed to him (all powerful, all knowing, almighty), and they profess to it, even though there is no evidence to support those characteristics in the face of all that is going with humanity and the crisis over the centuries; chances are surely that he exists but hasn’t shown up yet. He is yet to show up in our midst. Note; in the face of such a deity, even if he appears to look human, all that humanity had faced and counted as a loss cannot be lost in his sight. He can still (and will) recover all. His operation will never be according to human limitations but by the performance of the Spirit that reserved all supernatural support and powers for him whom he (the Spirit), has chosen to be God by, for the people. He is now among us and we have seen him. Is this too complex to comprehend?</strong></p>
